=== Spotify Playlist Generator ===

A simple tool to create Spotify playlists from a text file of song names.

== INSTALLATION ==

Simply run: 
python3 install.py

This will:
1. Create a Python virtual environment
2. Install required dependencies (spotipy, python-dotenv, ...)
3. Create a template .env file for your Spotify credentials
4. Update the script files

== CONFIGURATION ==

Before using, you must:
1. Create a Spotify Developer account at https://developer.spotify.com/
2. Create an application to get your client ID and secret
3. Edit the .env file with your credentials:
   - SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID
   - SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET
   - SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI (use http://localhost:8888/callback)

== USAGE ==

To create a playlist:
./spotylist_create.sh "My Playlist Name" songs.txt

Where songs.txt contains one song per line in any of these formats:
- Artist - Song Title (e.g., "Kavinsky - Nightcall")
- Spotify Track ID (22-character code)
- Spotify URI (spotify:track:xxxx)
- Spotify URL (open.spotify.com/track/xxxx)

== EXAMPLE PLAYLIST FORMAT ==

Timecop1983 – Tonight
FM‑84 feat. Ollie Wride – Running in the Night
The Midnight – Sunset
Magic Sword – In The Face Of Evil
Kavinsky – Nightcall
Dance With The Dead – That House

== TROUBLESHOOTING ==

- Check your .env file has correct credentials
- Make sure your playlist.txt file has one track per line
- For browser authentication issues, try using a private/incognito window
- Logs are saved to spotify_playlist.log for debugging
