> A simple tool to create Spotify playlists from a text file of song names.

## üìã Overview

**Spotify Playlist Generator** allows you to effortlessly generate Spotify playlists from text files. Simply list your favorite tracks in a text file, and this tool handles the rest - finding the songs on Spotify and creating playlists for you, placing them right into your Spotify library.

### What it does:
- Creates Spotify playlists from text files with minimal effort
- Handles artist-title formats, URLs, or Spotify IDs - whatever you throw at it
- Tries really hard to find the right songs with multiple search strategies
- Processes songs in batches so large playlists don't crash

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
python3 install.py
```

This will automatically:
- Create a Python virtual environment
- Install required dependencies (spotipy, python-dotenv, etc.)
- Create a template .env file for your Spotify credentials
- Update the script files

## üîë Configuration

Before using Spotify Playlist Generator, you need to set up your Spotify Developer credentials:

1. Create a Spotify Developer account at [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com/)
2. Create a new application to get your client ID and secret
3. Edit the generated `.env` file with your credentials:
   ```
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### GUI Interface (Recommended)

### Command Line Usage

Create a playlist with:

```bash

```

Where `playlist.txt` contains one song per line in any of these formats:
- Artist - Song Title (e.g., "Kavinsky - Nightcall")
- Spotify Track ID (22-character code)
- Spotify URI (spotify:track:xxxx)
- Spotify URL (open.spotify.com/track/xxxx)

## üìù Example Playlist Format

```
Timecop1983 ‚Äì Tonight
FM‚Äë84 feat. Ollie Wride ‚Äì Running in the Night
The Midnight ‚Äì Sunset
Magic Sword ‚Äì In The Face Of Evil
Kavinsky ‚Äì Nightcall
Dance With The Dead ‚Äì That House
```

## üé∂ Hint: You can easily use ChatGPT to create your .txt playlist files

Try something like: 
```
 "Hey ChatGPT, Create a Spotify playlist tailored to my taste 
  using the following format: 
    Artist - Song Title
    Artist - Song Title
    ... "
```
Save as .txt and enjoy the Playlist being loaded into your Spotify Account.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- Check your `.env` file has correct credentials

- When using the GUI, error messages are displayed in the console output area
